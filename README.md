# BVRGym
## Description
This library is based on JSBSim software (https://github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim). 
This library's primary purpose is to allow users to explore Beyond Visual Range (BVR) tactics using Reinforcement learning while utilizing JSBSim high-fidelity flight dynamics models.

## Requirments
The following libraries are required to run BVRGym. 
The code has been tested with Python 3.9 

pip install jsbsim pyproj pymap3d torch tensorboard py_trees


## BVRGym

BVRGym has a 3-level structure. Level 1 is the lowest level where Python interacts with the JSBSim flight dynamics simulator. Examples of Level 1 objects are located in the BVRGYM/jsb_gym/simObjects directory. Here we have both the aircraft class and the missile class. Level 2 represents agents, a wrapper that has both missiles and aircraft objects, i.e., they use level 1 objects. And level 3 is the environments that use agents. Each level has its own configuration files. 

To test these objects in an isolated scenario, install Flightgear (https://www.flightgear.org/), place yourself in the BVRGYM directory, and then run commands as explained below


### FlightGear
FlightGear offers an excellent tool for visualizing the units present in BVRGym. 

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:saiarcot895/flightgear`

`sudo apt update`

After installing FlightGear, start the program, go to the Aircraft tab, and download the General Dynamics F16 aircraft.

To have a missile model as well, copy the ogel folder from this repo (BVRGYM/fg/ogel) to the Flightgears aircraft directory.
To visualize a missile in FlightGear, I used the ogel (1) model within FGFS, replaced the graphical representations of the ogel with a missile available in FGFS (I think it was from (2)), and added a trail from Santa Claus (3) to see the trajectory.

2) https://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?t=19930#p183249

3) https://wiki.flightgear.org/Santa_Claus

Given that you have both the f16 and ogel directories in the fgfs directory (home/.fgfs/Aircraft/...), you will be able to visualize both units in the next steps

### To test aircraft (Level 1)

terminal 1 (Visualize F16):

`fgfs --fdm=null --native-fdm=socket,in,60,,5550,udp --aircraft=f16-block-52 --airport=ESSA --multiplay=out,10,127.0.0.1,5000 --multiplay=in,10,127.0.0.1,5001`

terminal 2:

`
python -m tests.test_aircraft.py
`

### To test missile (Level 1)

terminal 1: 

`fgfs --fdm=null --native-fdm=socket,in,60,,5550,udp --aircraft=f16-block-52 --airport=ESSA --multiplay=out,10,127.0.0.1,5000 --multiplay=in,10,127.0.0.1,5001`

terminal 2: 

`fgfs --fdm=null --native-fdm=socket,in,60,,5551,udp --aircraft=ogel --airport=ESSA --multiplay=out,10,127.0.0.1,5001 --multiplay=in,10,127.0.0.1,5000`

terminal 3:
`
python -m tests.test_missile.py
`

### Test Agent (Level 2)

Check that all the ammo is loaded.

`
python -m tests.test_agent.py
`

### Test Tacview (Level 3)

RL agent takes random actions, while the red aircraft is controlled by a behavior tree.

`
python -m tests.test_tacview.py
`

Open tacview (https://www.tacview.net/) and load data in BVRGym/data_output/tacview

## BVR air combat training

To start training an agent for BVR air combat, run the following command

`
python main.py 
`

Note that this article relates to an older version of the BVRGym, but it is still valid with remarks to understand Behavior Trees and other part of the environments.
